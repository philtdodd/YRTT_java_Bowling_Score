# YRTT_java_Bowling_Score

This TDD was very interesting I approached it from the Max Score downwards as this handled the complex end case.

Starting with a simple case would have not extracted the Strike in the tenth frame causing extra balls to be rolled. After this I did a spares for each frame. Then went on to test other test cases and finally added a CSV of tests
